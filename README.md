# Github actions demo for lambda
Quick example on creating a simple lamdba pipeline

This leverages github actions and sam to do a very simple pipeline.

Every push to master will trigger the pipeline to run.

### Steps:
1. Create s3 bucket called gha-lambda-jtest
2. Check regions in code
3. deploy

### Issues:
no simple way to destroy / undeploy
